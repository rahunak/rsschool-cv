## Briefly About Myself:
Hey i'm Eugenii,i'm 29,i'm father of a small princess.
In the past I worked ,as a teacher,as a truck driver,but every time i felt that it was not my cup of tea.

At school i started to learn html,css. During my univercity studies my outlook expanded with languages like Pascal,C#,JavaScript.
 
The last language interested my by its flexibility and power.
 Then working at univercity ,as ingenire-developer, i developed website layouts using Drupal CMS,a little Wordpress on local storage with Apache HTTP Server.
But diploma and subsequent job made adjustments.When i was working at school,i learned to be patient,non-conflict, not to be afraid of work. 
Then i tried a job as a truck driver,but that job hasn't brought me pleasure,but it had made me strong-willed,taught to think not only about the goal,but also about the way to achieve it.
In addition i have done courses in React,Redux,Axios,Git,got acquainted BEM-methodology,SOLID principies,and partial practices as YAGNI,DRY,KISS.
I made a small social networking site using all the technologies described.
 Now i want to consolidate all my knowledge and become a good specialist in web development.
I want to realize myself in what i love ,this is what i dreamt about. To do this,i'm ready for anything,even for a business trip in Nepal.
 I hope in the future i will be able to talk to people in English.
